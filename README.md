# Procedural Jellyfish

## Project Overview
I created a procedural jellyfish using Houdini. 

## Bell and Arms
I created the bell and arms of the jellyfish. 

## Veins
In order to create the veins for the jellyfish, I made use of the "Find Shortest Path" node. 

## Organs
Next, I created organs for my jellyfish. 

## Tentacles
I created tentacles for my jellyfish using simulate hair nodes

## Extra Credit
- I made a translucent texture for my jellyfish
- I added scalloped edges to the bell of the jellyfish
- I rendered my jellyfish
