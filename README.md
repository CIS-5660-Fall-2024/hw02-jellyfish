## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a detailed, procedural jellyfish model using Houdini, encompassing various aspects of 3D modeling, simulation, and rendering. The jellyfish is composed of several key components described below.  
| Image | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Bell](assets/Bell.png) | The main body of the jellyfish, created using Bended lines and revolve around axis. |
| ![Arms](assets/Arms.png) | Multiple appendages attached to the bell, created using rectangle and curves. |
| ![Veins](assets/Veins.png) | Internal structures within the bell, created using 'shortest path' algorithm to generate organic, branching patterns. |
| ![Organs](assets/Belly.png) |  Internal glowing parts of the jellyfish, created using Mountain nodes to add detail to the model. |
| ![Tentacles](assets/Tentacles.png) | Long, flowing appendages, created using hair systems and Vellum system simulated for realistic movement. |
